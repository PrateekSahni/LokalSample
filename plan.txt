The idea is first to think how the functions would work.

The first thing in mind was to think how to create task.

For Creating Todo - 

1. A bean is a must for populating data.
2. Simple thing is to create a form and populate the date into bean.

Now the question comes where we should store the Todo tasks.
Since this is a simple application we can overcome the headache of JDBC.

I have stored the data into session object. 

We will fetch the tasks of the user using session and store it into the same.

This way we have handled the logical and backend part.


-----------------------------------------------------


Now comes the front end part.

We will simple fetch the objects from session.

We will compare each task date with current date time.

if current times is less than the expiry time of task we will show it is active todo.

if current time is equal or greater than the expiry time of Todo we will show it in expired tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------

Coming to the form button we have used simple Jquery for hiding and showing the form
